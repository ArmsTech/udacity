MyReads: A Book Lending App
===========================

About
-----
From Udacity:
> Create a React application from scratch and utilize React components to
> manage the user interface. You’ll create a virtual bookcase to store your
> books and track what you're reading. Using the provided Books API, you’ll
> search for books and add them to a bookshelf as a React component. Use
> React's setState to build the functionality to move books from one shelf to
> another.

Supporting courses:
* React Fundamentals

MyReads was created using `create-react-app`, and the only starter code provided
was the interface to Udacity's books API. I chose to modify this interface
slightly to fix some inconsistencies in the data.
