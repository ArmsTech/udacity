Project: Mobile Flashcards
==========================

About
-----
From Udacity:
> You will build a mobile application (Android or iOS - or both) that allows
users to study collections of flashcards. The app will allow users to create
different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those
decks, then take quizzes on those decks.
