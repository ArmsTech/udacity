Project: Tournament Results
===========================

About
-----
From Udacity:
> In this project, youâ€™ll be writing a Python module that uses the PostgreSQL
> database to keep track of players and matches in a game tournament. The
> game tournament will use the Swiss system for pairing up players in each
> round: players are not eliminated, and each player should be paired with
> another player with the same number of wins, or as close as possible.
