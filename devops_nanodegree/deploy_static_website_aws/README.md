Project: Deploy a Static Website on AWS
=======================================

About
-----
From Udacity:
> The cloud is perfect for hosting static websites that only include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that require no server-side processing. In this project, you will deploy a static website to AWS. First, you will create a S3 bucket, configure the bucket for website hosting, and secure it using IAM policies. Next, you will upload the website files to your bucket and speed up content delivery using AWSâ€™s content distribution network service, CloudFront. Lastly, you will access your website in a browser using the unique S3 endpoint.
