Movie Trailer Website
=====================

About
-----
From Udacity:
> You will write server-side code to store a list of your favorite movies,
> including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. You will then serve this
> data as a web page allowing visitors to review their movies and watch the
> trailers.

This project is intended to demonstrate an understanding of core programming 
concepts, the Python programming language, and the typical role of a
web server (accept a request, execute code, and generate a response).

Please note that the scope of this project did not include persistent data
storage. In a real-world environment movies would be stored in a more suitable
way (e.g. database). Also, in a real-world setup templates would be used to
render HTML rather than manipulating HTML included in a Python module.

Quick Start
-----------

* Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/ArmsTech/udacity.git`
* Navigate to movie_trailer_website `cd udacity/movie_trailer_website`
* Run `python movie_trailer_website.py` or `./movie_trailer_website.py`

A browser should then open with the website or the website will open in a
new tab of your open browser.

Requirements
------------

* Python 2.7.x
* A web browser (e.g. Google Chrome)
* Linux, Mac OS X, (MS Windows may work but hasn't been tested)
